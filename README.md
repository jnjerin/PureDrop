# PureDrop

**Project Overview**

PureDrop is a system that helps in water conservation by detecting leakages in water pipes using IoT sensors to alert plumbers on the exact loacation of leakage for quick repair. The system is also used by households to track and monitor water usage. Consumers are given redeemable credits for conservative and efficient water usage.

**Innovation Overview**

PureDrop team wishes to introduce a water potability monitoring tool into the system to ensure consumers get safe water for drinking. The tool will utilize Artificial Intelligence to predict whether the water getting to consumers is safe for drinking or not. 

**Innovation Metric of Success**

The purpose of this section is to develop a fully functioning Machine Learning Model that will be deployed into the backend of PureDrop system. A User Interface will be intergrated whereby the user(water service provider/water treatment officers) can key in water potability check data points and get a feedback of whether the water is safe for drinking or not.
